# **The requirements of the project:**

 - Create a player subclass that plays randomly
-   Something different happens depending on the choice the player made.
- Keep score.
- Create a subclass for a human player that also validates the input.
- Create a  Reflect player class that remembers what move the  _opponent_  played last round, and plays that move  _this_  round. (In other words, if you play  paper in the first round, a  Reflect player will play  paper in the second round.)

- Create a  Cycle player class that remembers what move it played last round and cycles through the different moves. (If it played  rock  this round, it should play  paper  in the next round.)
- Announce the winner and provide a quit option or play again.
